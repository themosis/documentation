Introduction
============

The Themosis framework is a tool aimed to WordPress developers of any levels. Its main goal is to provide a common coding structure and better tools for bespoke WordPress application development.

In order to provide those tools, the Themosis framework has always been inspired by the [Laravel](https://laravel.com/)  framework. With each release, we tried to implement concepts and packages from Laravel into the framework.
